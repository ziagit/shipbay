                <div class="md-body-1">
                  Shipping TAB was founded to create a better way for people and businesses to
                  ship freight as well as moving their household. There were countless
                  carriers to choose from, but there was no way to compare them side by side.
                  That meant you had to either spend hours online or on the phone, comparing
                  rates and carriers, or just book with one carrier and hope you chose the
                  best possible option.
                  <div class="break"></div>
                  We were the first to solve this dilemma by developing our own patented
                  technology. It disrupted the freight industry and forever changed how people
                  and businesses ship freight.
                  <div class="break"></div>
                  Today, we’ve quoted thousands of shipments, delivering to virtually every
                  corner of Canada.
                  <div class="break"></div>
                  We can serve multitudes of customers and still maintain the highest
                  standards of service because we’ve committed, from the start, to integrating
                  technology and powerful data analytics into everything we do. From the
                  backend that gathers and organizes quotes to the self-service online tools
                  that give you all the information you need to manage freight like a pro, our
                  business is designed to serve yours.

                    <li>
                      Professionals offer packaging materials and packing services, which
                      ensures that all your belongings are safely loaded to a truck, shipped,
                      and offloaded from the truck.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Hiring a professional will also save you time. Since the moving company
                      is going to do everything for you from packing to loading to shipping to
                      offloading, you will have time to do other things and settle in your new
                      home.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Hiring professionals may also help you save money, this may sound
                      unlikely, but the truth is that your lack of experience in the job can
                      lead to damages that can cost you a lot if you choose DIY. Professionals
                      have the necessary skills to ensure that damages that are associated
                      with moving are minimized.

                  <b>Why choose us over other Household movers?</b><br />
                  Moving can be a stressful task, full of its fair share of unwelcomed
                  surprises, but what should not come as a surprise to you is the total amount
                  you see on your moving invoice once your move is completed. Before you
                  choose us as your moving company, one of our highly skilled Shipping TAP

                  <b>Loading</b> - Prior to loading your furniture and belongings, Shipping
                  TAP takes the time to make sure that each item is properly packed, listed
                  for inventory and labeled for moving. For upholstered furniture, we use a
                  durable, plastic Stretchwrap to guard against potential damage from dirt and
                  scratches. For other items, we use special packing to protect against
                  shifting. Once prepped, your personal contents are systematically loaded
                  onto our moving trucks where they will be transported to their new location.
                  <br />
                  <b>Transportation</b> - Safety is a top-priority for Shipping TAP and each
                  of our moving trailers contains suspension systems with airride protection.
                  Our drivers are all licensed and certified with quality training, and are
                  committed to making sure your belongings are transported in a professional
                  way. Whether it is a local, state to state or long distance move, we have
                  you covered.
                  <br />
                  <b>Unloading</b> - After delivery, we take inventory during the unloading
                  process to ensure that each item is accounted for. With your guidance and
                  instruction, our trained movers will carefully place all of your boxes and
                  furniture into each room, and we will provide re-assembly services as
                  requested.
