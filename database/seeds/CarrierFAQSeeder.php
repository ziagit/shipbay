                At ShippingTAP, we know that every trucking company runs differently. So, when
                we designed the ShippingTAP app and
                <router-link to="">web portal</router-link> , we listened to what carriers and
                their drivers had to say about the challenges facing them and we continue to
                listen today. The end result was tools that are easy to navigate and designed
                entirely for phone, desktops or laptops, so dispatchers and drivers can
                clearly and conveniently book a load.
                <div class="break"></div>
                Using our products comes at no cost and there are no hidden booking fees. With
                ShippingTAP prices are provided upfront which eliminates haggling and the time
                wasted with back and forth negotiations, allowing drivers to hit the road
                faster.

              Finding loads on the ShippingTAP web portal couldn’t be simpler. Better still,
              there are 2 ways you can find loads 24/7.
              <div class="break"></div>
              1) To find single loads, click on “Search” in the top menu bar. To find and set
              recurring loads, click on “Saved Lanes” in the top menu bar.
              <div class="break"></div>
              2) Specify your search criteria. Fields that are required are noted with an
              asterisk and click the “Search” button from the “Search” tab or click “Save”
              from the “Saved Lanes” tab and you will be shown a list of available loads that
              meet your specifications.
              <div class="break"></div>
              3) If you see a load you’re interested in, click on it and a new browser tab
              will open with the load details page. You can book the load immediately by
              clicking “Book load”. You will receive a booking confirmation email.
              <div class="break"></div>
              4) When you book a load, you have the option to assign a driver immediately or
              to do so at a later time. Don’t worry, if a load isn’t assigned to a driver,
              you’ll receive multiple notifications 24/12/4 hours before pickup.

                As trucking companies grow, it can become increasingly difficult for
                dispatchers to keep trucks utilized by assigning the right loads to the right
                drivers within their fleets. Deadhead, the industry term for kilometers a
                truck drives with an empty trailer, is one of the most costly problems in
                trucking. Surveys vary on the distance carriers drive without an active load —
                estimates range from a low of 15% to a high of 30%. That translates into tens
                of billions of lost kilometers every year, creating an enormous loss of time
                and fuel.

                  Carriers are famous for going their own way, especially when it comes to how
                  they run their businesses. There is one thing, however, all owner-operators or
                  fleets can probably agree on: you won’t make it far in trucking if the rates
                  aren’t right. Here’s how the web portal and app can help carriers make the
                  most out of their load-pricing strategy.
                </div>
                <div class="break"></div>
      
                <div class="md-title">No haggling required</div>
                <div class="md-body-1">
                  Inspired by our carriers, ShippingTAP believes there’s too much time wasted in
                  the traditional booking process of calling a brokerage. The concept of
                  electronically booking freight, if the price is fair, brings a cost effective
                  perspective to booking loads.
                  <div class="break"></div>
                  The web portal and app equips carriers, dispatchers and drivers with the tools
                  they need to easily visualize and accelerate their workflow. For example,
                  dispatchers can view and book loads, assign them to available drivers, and
                  manage them from end-to-end, all via their web browser. Additionally,
                  dispatchers can list their trucks’ availability, and ideal loads will be
                  recommended to them and available to book directly within the web portal.
                </div>
                <div class="break"></div>
      
                <div class="md-title">Plan ahead</div>
                <div class="md-body-1">
                  Downtime can also be a major problem for carriers. Scouring job boards while
                  sitting idle often pressures a carrier to find a load fast, and rushing can
                  mean overlooking better opportunities. This stressful situation can be
                  minimized or avoided entirely by planning ahead.
                  <div class="break"></div>
                  With ShippingTAP, carriers can better plan ahead. For example, whenever a new
                  load is booked available reloads are automatically shown. Additionally,
                  carriers can post their truck on the app to see future loads that match their
                  preferences.

                <div class="md-title">It’s all in the (load) details</div>
                <div class="md-body-1">
                  Deadhead in comparison to load length is also a major component that carriers
                  look for. Load weight and topography can improve fuel economy, and thereby
                  increase their rate per kilometre, significantly— which are the sort of
                  details carrier are able to find in the ShippingTAP app or web portal.
                  <div class="break"></div>
                  Whether it’s load weight, location, or time of delivery, the powerful search
                  feature helps carriers find the exact load they are looking for to maximize
                  their business.

                tracking updates.

                    yourself through in-app support.

                  <li>
                    Re-open the app at critical points in the load (such as dispatch, pickup,

                    Charge your phone continuously during the trip (avoid low battery mode)
                    and keep the ShippingTAP app open in the foreground with the screen on

              <div class="md-body-1">
                We recommend setting up with one or more automatic tracking options—the
                ShippingTAP app or Project44. While there may still be instances where we will
                need to call or email depending on the load, having location updates can help
                reduce the frequency of calls or emails.
              </div>
              <div class="break"></div>
    
              <div class="md-title">
                Will I still get calls and emails when I’m integrated with an automated
                tracking source?
              </div>
              <div class="md-body-1">
                When automated tracking is working properly, we do not expect to call drivers
                or dispatchers to obtain tracking updates.
                <div class="break"></div>
                However, if real-time location data is not transmitting properly or if there
                are non-tracking reasons that we need to contact you regarding a load,
                ShippingTAP may still call to confirm necessary load details or inquire about
                other matters.

              <div class="break"></div>
    
              <div class="md-title">Can I use more than one of the tracking methods?</div>
              <div class="md-body-1">
                Absolutely. Using multiple methods increases the likelihood of real-time
                location updates being received.

              </div>
              <div class="md-body-1">
                Our preference is for you to share your location through the Shippingtab
                Freight app or through Project44. These methods are updated in real time and
                allow you to communicate with us when needed throughout the load (e.g., the
                app allows you to confirm dispatch prior to pickup).

              <div class="md-body-1">
                In order for ShippingTAP to match your device to a load and successfully
                receive location updates, we need to verify the truck and trailer number. This
                is mandatory across all EU loads with Shippingtab Freight.

                Please send all truck and trailer number information to
                tracking-eu@Shippingtab.com. In the future, you will be able to provide this
                information through the ShippingTAP app or web portal.

              <div class="md-body-1">
                Truck and trailer information should be provided to ShippingTAP at least 3
                hours before pick up. If possible, please provide truck and trailer
