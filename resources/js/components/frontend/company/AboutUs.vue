            <div class="md-body-1">
              Shipping TAB was founded to create a better way for people and businesses to
              ship freight as well as moving their household. There were countless
              carriers to choose from, but there was no way to compare them side by side.
              That meant you had to either spend hours online or on the phone, comparing
              rates and carriers, or just book with one carrier and hope you chose the
              best possible option.
              <div class="break"></div>
              We were the first to solve this dilemma by developing our own patented
              technology. It disrupted the freight industry and forever changed how people
              and businesses ship freight.
              <div class="break"></div>
              Today, we’ve quoted thousands of shipments, delivering to virtually every
              corner of Canada.
              <div class="break"></div>
              We can serve multitudes of customers and still maintain the highest
              standards of service because we’ve committed, from the start, to integrating
              technology and powerful data analytics into everything we do. From the
              backend that gathers and organizes quotes to the self-service online tools
              that give you all the information you need to manage freight like a pro, our
              business is designed to serve yours.

              Do you need help moving your things to your new home?
              <div class="break"></div>
              With the Shipping TAP, we even load, unload and take care of the transport

              <b>Why you should choose a moving company?</b><br />
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Professionals offer packaging materials and packing services, which
                  ensures that all your belongings are safely loaded to a truck, shipped,
                  and offloaded from the truck.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hiring a professional will also save you time. Since the moving company
                  is going to do everything for you from packing to loading to shipping to
                  offloading, you will have time to do other things and settle in your new
                  home.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Hiring professionals may also help you save money, this may sound
                  unlikely, but the truth is that your lack of experience in the job can
                  lead to damages that can cost you a lot if you choose DIY. Professionals
                  have the necessary skills to ensure that damages that are associated
                  with moving are minimized.
                </li>

              <b>Why choose us over other Household movers?</b><br />
              Moving can be a stressful task, full of its fair share of unwelcomed
              surprises, but what should not come as a surprise to you is the total amount

              <b>Loading</b> - Prior to loading your furniture and belongings, Shipping
              TAP takes the time to make sure that each item is properly packed, listed
              for inventory and labeled for moving. For upholstered furniture, we use a
              durable, plastic Stretchwrap to guard against potential damage from dirt and
              scratches. For other items, we use special packing to protect against
              shifting. Once prepped, your personal contents are systematically loaded
              onto our moving trucks where they will be transported to their new location.

              way. Whether it is a local, state to state or long distance move, we have

              process to ensure that each item is accounted for. With your guidance and
              instruction, our trained movers will carefully place all of your boxes and
              furniture into each room, and we will provide re-assembly services as
              requested.
