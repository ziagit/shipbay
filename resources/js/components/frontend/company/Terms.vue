            offloading for LTL shipments. Quotes are based on the information
            Shippers provide; however, if the actual shipment characteristics
            are materially different than specified by the Shipper and result in
            changes such as but not limited to equipment required, space
            required, accessorial services required, excess wait time, all
            duties, customs assessments, governmental penalties and fines,

            invoice a different amount than the original quote, and the Shippers
            shall be responsible for all additional costs incurred. The quotes

            of lading containing the booking information provided by the shipper
            and their selection of carrier, for the use in tendering the
            shipment. The bill of lading issued in connection with each shipment
            is non-negotiable and shall be deemed, conclusively, to have been
            prepared by the Shipper. Failure by the Shipper to provide the bill
            of lading generated by the system may result in the loss of the
            quoted rate. Any changes to the shipment after booking requires a
            new bill of lading with updated information, which is to be done by
            cancelling the previous shipment and booking a new request.
